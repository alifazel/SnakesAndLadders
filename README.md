# Snakes And Ladders

## Objectives

* Understand network programming (Server-Client model, socket connectivity and streaming).
* Develop rich user interfaces using the Swing toolkit
* Work with the Graphics2D Library
* Explore more advanced design patterns and OOP solutions (event dispatcher, observer pattern etc)

## Description of project

Create a multi-player LAN based Snakes and Ladders game in Java. The game allows up to 4 clients to play simultaneously. This served as an introduction for network programming and allowed me to work with sockets and streaming of data between servers and clients. I learned about more advanced design patterns related to this area of development which included event dispatchers, action listeners which I implemented using the Observer pattern. I also improved on my existing knowledge of the Swing toolkit and explored the Graphics2D library in greater detail.

This project was done in collaboration with a colleague and allowed me to experience pair programming for the first time.
